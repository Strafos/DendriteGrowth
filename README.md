dendrite.m is the main file which graphs the progression of dendrites with time using a sobel filter.

sobelEdgeTuner.m can be used to tune variables for better edge detection. These variables can be entered into sobelEdgeFinder.m for better edge detection.

GUI.m and GUI.fig allow user to manually track dendrites by click. 

vidToImg.m turns video into images of equally spaced out frames.
A sample video is included, 2mA_sample_vid.avi
